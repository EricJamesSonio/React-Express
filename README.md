Start Date : October 29, 2025

Tech Stack :
* Frontend - React.js + Vite
* Backend - Express.js

React.js 
- Vite (For faster)
- Axios (For api calling instead of fetch)
- websockets install 
- TypeScript (Optional for bug detection and strict)
- bycrypt (Optional for hashing, converting hash etc.)
- etc.


Express.js
- bycrypt (Optional For hashing passwords, keys etc.)
- websockets install


FullStack Plans, Infrastructure, Requirements, Helpers! etc.
* Personal Use
* Steps & Plan in building effective fullstack project!
* Making clean fullstack project, managing folders, codes, strategies, designs
* Reusable codes
* Websockets to stay in sync 
* Flexible and adaptive database based on env. (docker or localhost) should work.
* Security

Docker Set-up
* Docker files and Docker-compose comese from https://github.com/EricJamesSonio/Guitar-store
* docker
* Maintain flexibility between local and Docker environments
* Keep local `.env` for development (XAMPP)
* Use `.env.docker` for containerized deployment
* Avoid code duplication and redundant configurations
* Support full-stack Docker orchestration (client, server, database)
* Ensure portability and consistency across environments

SOME DETAILS:
* Client :
[Architecture]
- Modulized files, folders
- SRP, DRY etc.
- Sync Connection between client and server
- WebSockets, Context provider
- Customizable design
- Flexible design
- Clean structures

* Server:
[Architecture]
- Modulized files, folders
- SRP, DRY, OOP, Algorithms
- Sync Connection using sockets
- Testable Codes
- Reusable services
- Database seeds, creation, configs
- Error handling
